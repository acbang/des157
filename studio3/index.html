		<h3>ADVENTURE</h3>
		<p>I bought this hat in the Dongdaemun district of Seoul, South Korea, on a vacation with my family in 2015. I remember being in an underground street market and seeing a vendor selling a lot of different and cool hats, this one included. Me and the shopkeeper went back and forth haggling between prices, until we decided on 1500 won (roughly $15 USD). I wonder if I could have gotten it for less?</p>

		<h3>FRIENDSHIP</h3>
		<p>During my winter break in 2015, one of my friends wanted to celebrate their birthday in Disneyland; she invited me to come, but I was unsure if I should go to Disneyland with her or spend my break working and picking up extra shifts. All things considered, I decided to go. Two days spent park-hopping with my friends and I found out that I <i>really</i> like Big Thunder Mountain Railroad; I wish I could explain why...</p>

		<h3>IDENTITY</h3>
		<p>The "scribbles" you see on this hat is the script for Baybayin, a written script for the Tagalog language of the Philippines. During my time in college, one of the most meaningful things I decided to do was to get involved with the Filipino American community here at UC Davis. Throughout my time, I got to learn about the aspect of my identity as a Filipino American and how that relates to my life experiences. Without the FilAm community, I would not be who I am today. (Know history, know self; no history, no self.)</p>

		<h3>NOSTALGIA</h3>
		<p>One of my close friends gave me this hat because they knew how much I loooooved Pokemon. When I think about my childhood, I think about all the times I spent playing Pokemon on my Gameboy and the time I spent reading walkthroughs and making shoddy graphic design in the form of fanart for the game. One thing that I kinda get sad thinking about is growing up and losing that childhood innocence. It's like, I wish I could go back to the days when I was an Eevee and not an Espeon lol.</p>

		<h3>SPONTANEITY</h3>
		<p>When I think about an iconic moment from my time here at UC Davis, one thing that definitely pops into my head is a spontaneous trip me and two of my friends took to Southern California. Four our spring break, we had decided on Thursday night to take a roadtrip to SoCal that following Friday morning. At night, we bummed it in my friend's car and took our showers at Laguna Beach. We got to explore a lot of different sights and eat at different places, so it was totally worth it. I never thought I would have ever been so down to be so spontaneous, but I guess spontaneous moments make for some of the best memories.</p>
