			<h3>STORYBOARDS 1/2</h3>
			<article>In developing my storyboards, I was able to learn more about the possible settings that my project could be set within or possible emotions that my users could have. In my first storyboard, I imagined an interactive kiosk that would hold my data visualization interface and people could interact with it by tapping on the graphs and charts on the screen. When I showed my storyboard to someone in class, the first thing they said was: "I don't actually know what (data) disaggregation is...". Upon hearing that, I made it a goal to provide a user with background information and context about what the issue is, especially since it's kind of abstract and complex to understand. With that in mind, I started to reimagine another scenario, also in a museum, but with a wall projection in the form of a narrative. In presenting this storyboard, my classsmate was then wondering whether it would be a passive or active experience, if the projection just started to run through the presentation. With that in mind, I then learned that another challenge I'd have to face in the future would be trying to find the balance between a passive, narrative experience (where it would be easier for users to learn and understand the concept, at the expense of engagement) and an active, self-directed experience (where users would be able to navigate through the interface how they would like, at the expense of possible not understanding what they are looking at).</article>
