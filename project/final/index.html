				<h2>what is the model minority myth?</h2>
				<p><i>model minority myth</i> refers to the social construct in which a minority group is perceived to be "higher performing" in comparison to other minority groups.</p>

				<h2>what is data disaggregation?</h2>
				<p><i>data disaggregation</i> refers to information that breaks down summarized, aggregated data into smaller units or groupings in order to understand the data set better.</p>

				<h2>why is it important?</h2>
				<p>although disaggregated data is a general term for data that information that has been compiled from other sources of data, this project will focus on the social impact that data disaggregation has on specifically the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. While the scope of this project only focuses on the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, it is important to understand data disaggregation as it applies to other (intersecting) identities.</p>

				<h2>who does it affect?</h2>
				<p>although Asian American and Pacific Islanders are stereotyped and seen as high-performing in many different fields (like education and health), especially through the lens of the model minority myth, the data used to support that assumption is typically aggregated. It does not reflect discrepancies between each ethnic subgroup, resulting in some struggles and narratives of certain AAPI subgroups to be "unseen" and "unknown".</p>
